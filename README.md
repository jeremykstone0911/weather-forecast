# weather-forecast

The main objective of this project is to use a server-side API. In this case we achieved this by retrieving weather data from OpenWeatherMap.org. The user can choose a specified city and the DOM will update with today's current weather information (temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index) as well as display this same information for the next 5 days. After a search has been performed, the city in which was used for the search becomes an option to select for future use.
